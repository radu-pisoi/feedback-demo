John: We should warn the readers that over tightening the filter will damage the filter's gasket.
  Me: Thank you John, I will add that most oil filters need to be tightened by hand. 
  Over tightening them might damage the gasket.

Mary: In step 8, I think you meant to write "Top off" instead of "Top up".
    Moderator: Thank you for noticing this Mary. I will get this corrected as soon as possible.
        Mary: You're welcome. I'm always happy to help.
    
John: I see that there are related links for the "Windshield washer fluid". 
  Perhaps there should also be a related link to a page that describes the "Oil".
  Me: Thank you for the suggestion.
